  abstract = {IntroductionCurrent research on occupational gender stereotypes in language has indicated that gender bias is influenced by various aspects, including social knowledge about roles associated with either men or women as well as linguistic information. This study focuses on gender perception of language users of Estonian and Russian. The former is a grammatically genderless Finno-Ugric language, while the latter has grammatical gender. Based on previous studies, we investigate whether occupational gender stereotypes in these languages are evoked by social beliefs, stereotypes and other extralinguistic factors and/or by language. Additionally, we examine whether the extent of gender bias varies across these languages.MethodsTwo separate web-based Likert scale surveys were conducted, one in Estonian and the other in Russian. The surveys included sentences featuring 36 occupational titles in Estonian and 34 in Russian. Data were analyzed using R software, employing principal component analysis and binomial logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 581 Estonian-speaking as well as 326 Russian-speaking participants took part in the study. Analyses revealed that biased responses were primarily influenced by social knowledge, followed by the influence of language. In Russian, results indicated that stereotypical information often overrides linguistic cues.DiscussionThe results suggest that gender perceptions are shaped by social knowledge and stereotypes, which work in cooperation with language. Based on these results, we propose that Estonian, while grammatically genderless and thus seemingly gender neutral, evokes as much or even more bias than grammatically gendered Russian.},

  abstract = {THIS chapter has three main aims: to discuss the meaning of the term `domestic work', the status of such work and the associations it has, in particular as `women's work' belonging to an `inside' sphere, and as something less than `real work'; then to discuss the implications for women's domestic work, and the meanings associated with it, of rural reforms and modernisation. It also examines the nature of the tasks undertaken as domestic work, the circumstances in which they are undertaken, the division of labour in domestic work, and the time spent by women in such work.DEFINITIONS AND PERCEPTIONSThe notion that domestic work is in some way oppressive has been central to Chinese Marxist approaches to women's liberation. Yet for all the centrality of this idea there has been little rigorous discussion of why this is so. Furthermore, what exactly is meant by `domestic work' is almost never spelt out. It is taken for granted that we all know what it is. I would argue, however, that one of the most important steps to take in order to understand the part domestic work plays in maintaining women's subordination is to recognise that definitions of domestic work are both arbitrary and constantly changing. In this chapter, therefore, we need to examine the particular ways in which certain tasks are defined as domestic work and the changing meanings associated with that term, as well as changes in the content of domestic work and the way it is organised.},

  abstract = {REFORM in the post-Mao era has resulted in significant changes to the type of agricultural work undertaken by rural people, the organisation of that work, gender divisions of labour in agricultural work and between agriculture and other work, and the way in which agriculture is perceived and valued in comparison to other activities.This chapter is not a detailed empirical study of the work of women and men in agriculture. Instead it seeks to outline gender divisions of labour within agriculture, and then to discuss two key trends relating to divisions of labour between agriculture and other forms of remunerated work that have emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. The first of these is a withdrawal of women from agriculture in areas where there is a surplus of agricultural labour, but a lack of alternative employment. The second is a contrasting trend in which responsibility for agriculture has been taken over by women, whilst larger numbers of men have been absorbed into non-agricultural employment.GENDER DIVISIONS OF LABOUR IN AGRICULTUREOn the eve of reforms in the late 1970s the majority of both men and women in rural areas worked in some form of agricultural labour. There were, however, significant differences in their patterns of employment.},

  abstract = {Abstract This chapter will firstly review the current legal framework of securing equal land rights between women and men in China. Secondly, based on the sample survey undertaken in Shanxi Province in 1996,3 this chapter will examine the current state of land distribution, identify the causes of gender inequality in terms of security of land rights, and determine the impact of ?insecure? land rights on the socioeconomic status of women. Finally, the policy implications will be examined. This chapter proves that the legislative framework and economic institutions in general protect gender equality in land distribution. However, loopholes in the detailed institutional arrangements lead to the insecurity of women's land rights, especially for divorced women, women re-location due to marriage, and for their children who miss out on land redistribution as undertaken in their village communities. Although these phenomena have not yet significantly affected the intra-household bargaining power of the agricultural women, they do tend to reduce the households of the landless women to poverty. It is therefore necessary to add a gender perspective to the current Land Administrative Law and to relevant government regulations regarding farmland tenure.},
